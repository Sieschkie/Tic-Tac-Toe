# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This Kotlin program allows you to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against another player. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the players take turns marking the spaces with their respective symbols ('X' or 'O'). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can enter their moves by specifying the row and column numbers.
- **Winning Conditions**: The program automatically detects winning combinations and announces the winner.
- **Draw Detection**: If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
- **Input Validation**: The program validates user input to ensure it falls within the acceptable range of coordinates and is a valid move.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers.
3. The game automatically checks for winning combinations and announces the winner or ends in a draw.

## Notes

- The game continues until a player wins or the board is full.
